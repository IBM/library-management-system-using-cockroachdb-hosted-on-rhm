# Library Management System using CockroachDB hosted on RHM

A Library Management System is a software that uses to maintain the record of the library. It contains work like the number of available books in the library, the number of books are issued or returning or renewing a book or late fine charge record, etc.

In this code pattern, we will build a Library Management System using CockroachDB hosted on RHM. CockroachDB is an ultra resilient, distributed SQL that can easily scale-out serializable transactions for your apps and services. It is cloud-native, architected to simplify scale and also guarantee consistent transactions across multiple regions and multiple clouds.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Install CockroachDB Operator from Red Hat Marketplace on a OpenShift Cluster
* Create a CockroachDB cluster instance
* Create a user and database in CockroachDB
* Store and query unstructured JSON data from a third-party API in CockroachDB
* Manage CockroachDB cluster from the Cluster Overview page

<!--Optionally, add flow steps based on the architecture diagram-->
