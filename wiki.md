# Summary

In this code pattern, we will build a Library Management System using CockroachDB hosted on Red Hat Marketplace. CockroachDB is an ultra resilient, distributed SQL that can easily scale-out serializable transactions for your apps and services. It is cloud-native, architected to simplify scale and also guarantee consistent transactions across multiple regions and multiple clouds.

# Technologies

* Databases
* Python
